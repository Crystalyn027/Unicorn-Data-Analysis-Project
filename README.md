# Unicorn-Data-Analysis-Project
Masterschool Capstone Project

For this project I have combined what I have learned in the preceding courses on SQL, Spreadsheets, and Tableau. 
The project includes three main parts, each with their own subtasks:

1. Explore a Unicorn data sample organized into a database with four tables. Answer predefined questions employing SQL.
2. Explore a unified dataset (.csv file) in Spreadsheets and visualize the data and find interesting insights. I used Excel.
3. Use Tableau to perform exploratory data analysis and pull unique insights from the dataset. Create a dashboard that will present the finding in a dynamic way.
